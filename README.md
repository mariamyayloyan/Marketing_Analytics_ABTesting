# Marketing Analytics A/B Testing

This repository contains an implementation of a multi-armed bandit problem with different algorithms designed for marketing analytics and A/B testing experiments. It simulates multiple bandit arms, each representing different variants of a marketing campaign, to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing the reward (e.g., conversions, engagement) over time. The following algorithms are implemented:

- **Epsilon-Greedy**
- **Thompson Sampling**

The results of the experiments are visualized using `matplotlib`, showing the comparison between different strategies and their effectiveness over time.
The results of the experiments are reported in a jupyter notebook file and csv files.
